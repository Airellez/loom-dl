# loom-dl

This script allows you to download public loom videos as a `.mp4** file so that you can watch them when being offline.

It only supports basic videos.

If you want support for videos with chapters or password protected videos consider using an alternative like [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

## Usage

```shell
$ ./loomdl.py https://www.loom.com/share/... -o out/video.mp4
```
